### Features and capabilities

1. Save your webpages with their original styles to the browser's database, without worrying about any privacy leaks, and without relying on the network.

2. Remove unnecessary content elements and large images to save disk space.

3. Enable fast keyword search to quickly locate saved page content, facilitating efficient filtering.

4. Multiple cached pages from the same website share related CSS files and other resources, saving disk space.

5. When you need to access content from multiple websites, using this plugin eliminates the need to open multiple browser tabs, saving memory resources.

6. The plugin locally stores all your preference configurations, such as previously used search keywords and sorting preferences.

（Please note that this plugin is not suitable for interactive websites that rely on JavaScript or make frequent requests to remote servers, as it is not designed for such scenarios.）
